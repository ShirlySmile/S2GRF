## Abstract

Multisource optical remote sensing (RS) image classification has obtained extensive research interest with demonstrated superiority. Existing approaches mainly improve classification performance by exploiting complementary information from multisource data. However, these approaches are insufficient in effectively extracting data features and utilizing correlations of multisource optical RS images. For this purpose, this article proposes a generalized spatial–spectral relation-guided fusion network ( S2 RGF-Net) for multisource optical RS image classification. First, we elaborate on spatial-and spectral-domain-specific feature encoders based on data characteristics to explore the rich feature information of optical RS data deeply. Subsequently, two relation-guided fusion strategies are proposed at the dual-level (intradomain and interdomain) to integrate multisource image information effectively. In the intradomain feature fusion, an adaptive de-redundancy fusion module (ADRF) is introduced to eliminate redundancy so that the spatial and spectral features are complete and compact, respectively. In interdomain feature fusion, we construct a spatial–spectral joint attention module (SSJA) based on interdomain relationships to sufficiently enhance the complementary features, so as to facilitate later fusion. Experiments on various multisource optical RS datasets demonstrate that S2 RGF-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.[[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580956).
